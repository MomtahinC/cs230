Finding system requirements for Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devies. 

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The Gaming Room UML diagram helped while developing the code. 

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Domain Model, I would try to go in more depth of the model 

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I imagined myself playing the game and what would bother me or help me while playing. It's important to consider the user's needs while designing because it'll be them who is going be playing the game.
